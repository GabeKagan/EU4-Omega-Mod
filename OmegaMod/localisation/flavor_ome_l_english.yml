 #Initialization events
 flavor_ome.1.t:0 "Genesis of the Omega"
 flavor_ome.1.d:0 "Our country's citizens wake from horrible nightmares of demoniac conquest. While our scholars and clergy struggle to interpret this, scattered rumors from beyond our borders speak of a ruler giving their country over to a force more terrible than the Frank, the Turk, and the Mongol combined. It is unclear how long we have to prepare for its arrival."
 flavor_ome.1.a:0 "Oh dear."
 flavor_ome.2.t:0 "No Protectorates for the Omega (AI)"
 flavor_ome.2.d:0 "This event occasionally turns any protectorates the Omega forms into straight up vassals, in an attempt to speed up its attempts at conquest."
 flavor_ome.2.a:0 "We must refrain from indirect rule"
 flavor_ome.3.t:0 "Free Explorers for the Omega (AI)"
 flavor_ome.3.d:0 "I'm having trouble making sure the Omega takes the Exploration idea group. As a stopgap, they get a free explorer every now and then, so long as they have coastal provinces."
 flavor_ome.3.a:0 "Kludges are pretty great."
 flavor_ome.4.t:0 "The Omega has broken free!"
 flavor_ome.4.d:0 "In a display of pure spite and anti-rationality, the Omega has turned their back on the oaths of fealty they swore. \n This is actually a balance event. Until I can modify the Omega's AI, it will not free itself through war frequently enough for my tastes. If you're at the point where you're about to defeat the Omega, don't take halfway measures - just annex them."
 flavor_ome.4.a:0 "If they won't submit, we will slaughter them to the last drone!"
 flavor_ome.5.t:0 "Assimilation at the hands of the Omega (AI)"
 flavor_ome.5.d:0 "Upon attempting to subjugate the Omega, our ruler has rapidly learned of the overwhelming superiority of their government's methods. Fire and blood pours forth from our magistrates' mouths, at least when they aren't pressuring us to redefine ourselves as Omegan subjects. It would appear they are possessed, and it appears we soon w..w...w... ALL GLORY TO THE OMEGA.\nThis event should only fire for the AI. If you see it during normal play, then your country is about to be annexed, and I sincerely apologize."
 flavor_ome.5.a:0 "Crud buckets! (Please report this)"
 flavor_ome.6.t:0 "Adjusting the Omega's Strength"
 flavor_ome.6.d:0 "You now have a chance to alter the Omega's strength. An easier Omega loses part of its innate buffs, while a harder one gains several new and dangerous ones."
 flavor_ome.6.a:0 "Let's weaken them!"
 flavor_ome.6.b:0 "Let's tempt fate and strengthen them!"
 flavor_ome.6.c:0 "Actually, let's just maintain the status quo."
 flavor_ome.6.e:0 "The Omega will no longer enjoy increased tax efficiency. It will also lose half of its global unrest and technology cost reduction."
 flavor_ome.6.f:0 "The Omega's tax efficiency bonus will increase to 100%, and all of its provinces will produce more goods, equivalent to a 2.5 base tax increase. It will also require 20% fewer admin points to increase stability. Countries at war with the Omega will suffer a significant unrest penalty."
 flavor_ome.6.g:0 "The Omega won't gain or lose any bonuses beyond what it starts with, and what it gets when it runs low on owned provinces."
 flavor_ome.7.t:0 "Genesis of the Omega (Player Triggered)"
 flavor_ome.7.d:0 "You should only see this event if you triggered the Omega's transformation through the console. Perhaps you wanted to observe the Omega in a particular location; perhaps you're a developer testing this mod. Either way, you're now the Omega. Blood fills your eyes, yada yada yada."
 flavor_ome.7.a:0 "Oh... dear?"
 #Adjectives and attitudes
 omegan:0 "Omegan"
 omegan_desc:0 "With the Omegan technology group, technologies are normal cost. However, the Omega also recieves a 10 year bonus."
 attitude_omegan:0 "Overwhelming"
 attitude_omegan_desc:0 "The Omega wants you dead, and seeks to usurp §Y$TARGET$§! and add it to their realm. No exceptions."

 omegan_culture:0 "Omegan"
 #Drones
 omega_drones_title:0 "Omega Drone"
 omega_drones_name:0 "$COUNTRY$ Omega Hive"
 omega_drones_desc:0 "These poor citizens have been linked into the Omegan hive mind against their will, and are being forced to assimilate even more of their fellow subjects. Although they have lost their free will, they have access to some of the knowledge of the main Omegan brain cluster, as well as any information they learned before being possessed."
 omega_drones_army:0 "Drone Cluster"
 omega_drones_demand:0 "Annexation by the Omega"
 omega_drones_demand_desc:0 "Omegan drones demand $COUNTRY$ submission to the Omega."
 #Omegan Insurrection
 omegan_insurrection:0 "Omegan Insurrection"
 crush_omegan_drones:0 "Crushing All Suspected Drones"
 desc_crush_omegan_drones:0 "Anyone who might possibly be collaborating with the Omega is killed. Our citizens now fear our power almost as much of that of the Omega."
 mercy_for_drones:0 "Mercy Towards Suspected Drones"
 desc_mercy_for_drones:0 "Our citizens will not move against a suspected drone without decisive evidence. This gives the drones more latitude to act, but helps ensure our people's cooperation in rooting them out."
 learning_from_the_omega:0 "Learning From The Omega"
 desc_learning_from_the_omega:0 "By putting down the most organized Omegan incursion yet, we've been able to incorporate a few techniques of theirs that aren't innately evil into our administration."
 omegan_disaster_rapid_response:0 "Rapid Anti-Drone Response Team"
 desc_omegan_disaster_rapid_response:0 "Many of our best soldiers have been deployed to quash drone uprisings before they become a problem. They have been allowed to use extreme methods that, while admittedly effective, are very unpopular with our subjects."
 #Disaster events
 omegan_disaster.1.t:0 "Beginning of the Omegan Insurrection"
 omegan_disaster.1.desc:0 "YOU CANNOT RESIST THE OMEGA. JOIN US OR DIE. OUR LOYALISTS HAVE INFILTRATED EVERY PART OF YOUR PATHETIC SOCIETY."
 omegan_disaster.1.a:0 "This is the worst thing since I got caught stealing cookies as a child!"
 omegan_disaster.2.t:0 "Formulating an Anti-Drone Policy"
 omegan_disaster.2.desc:0 "The initial shock of such coordinated and organized Omegan drone activity has begun to wear off. In order to root out the undercover Omegan presence in our country, we will have to adopt a consistent policy on how to deal with the Omega's hive mind."
 omegan_disaster.2.a:0 "Kill at the first sign of suspicious activity!"
 omegan_disaster.2.b:0 "Protect the populace by only attacking confirmed drones."
 omegan_disaster.3.t:0 "Purging an Omegan Hive"
 omegan_disaster.3.desc:0 "Our advantageous position in the war with the Omega and our recent discovery of a particularly large drone cluster have come together to create an interesting opportunity. We have the resources to purge these drones and thusly weaken the insurrection, although if we are not careful it may start attacking and converting our people. There is some objection, since this may require us to take troops off the frontlines for a while."
 omegan_disaster.3.a:0 "Give it a shot"
 omegan_disaster.3.b:0 "No, it's too dangerous"
 omegan_disaster.4.t:0 "Purging an Omegan Hive With A Great Advantage"
 omegan_disaster.4.desc:0 "We have accumulated a substantial advantage over the Omega, and can now potentially devote significant resources towards weakening their drone clusters' influence in our country. One of our army's captains has discovered a settlement that serves as a major drone base of operations; if we besiege it and destroy it, it will severely impact the hive's ability to control our people."
 omegan_disaster.4.a:0 "Give it a shot"
 omegan_disaster.4.b:0 "No, it's really too dangerous"
 omegan_disaster.5.t:0 "The Omega Offers A Humiliating Ceasefire!"
 omegan_disaster.5.desc:0 "The Omega has thoroughly battered our country from within and without. For reasons unknown to us, they have offered to return to the antebellum status quo in return for tribute and symbolic concessions. Our advisors warn that this will not stop the drone insurrection, and that accepting it may anger and frighten our citizens, but it also may be the only way to protect the integrity of the country."
 omegan_disaster.5.a:0 "It can't be that bad, can it?"
 omegan_disaster.5.b:0 "Absolutely never!"
 omegan_disaster.6.t:0 "Major Drone Uprising!"
 omegan_disaster.6.desc:0 "Another cluster of Omegan drones has grown strong enough to actively threaten us! What should we do?"
 omegan_disaster.6.a:0 "Why are you asking me? Just kill them!"
 omegan_disaster.6.b:0 "Hire some elite mercenaries to assassinate their leader."
 omegan_disaster.6.c:0 "You're right, we need to devote resources to preventing this!"
 omegan_disaster.6.ct:0 "Your country will use its best soliders to preempt drone clusters. This disables the 'Major Drone Uprising' event during the disaster, and reduces global unrest, but incurs a nasty penalty to your army's fighting ability and your income."
 omegan_disaster.7.t:0 "The End of the Omegan Insurrection"
 omegan_disaster.7.desc:0 "The nightmare is over! While a few scattered drones probably remain active and hooked into the Omegan hive mind, we have learned to be more vigilant to their efforts, and also learned a great deal about our enemy. In the near future, we should be able to apply this knowledge not only to fight the Omega, but to fight our human rivals as well."
 omegan_disaster.7.a:0 "Order has been restored!"
 #Government titles, which are form-agnostic and kind of goofy, like most of the localization

 #The Omegan "religion"
 omegan_religion:0 "Omegan Religions"
 omeganism:0 "Omeganism"
 omeganism_religion_desc:0 "Omeganism is not exactly a religion, unless you count personality cults as religions. It is little more than a set of techniques the Omega uses to enforce social cohesion and obedience that are so brutal and alien (although effective) that even the most tyrannical monarch will reject them without a second thought."
 OME_SUPREMACIST:0 "Supremacist"
 OME_INDIVIDUALIST:0 "Individualist"
