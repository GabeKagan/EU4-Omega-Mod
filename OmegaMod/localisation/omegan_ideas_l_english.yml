 overwhelming_innovation:0 "Overwhelming Innovation"
 overwhelming_innovation_desc:0 "Omegan citizens are now being connected into a crude mimicry of the homeworld's hive mind. This is not only useful for making them act and speak as one, but also allows us to timeshare out their higher cognitive functions for scientific research."
 native_assimilation:0 "Native Assimilation"
 native_assimilation_desc:0 "While the more sophisticated nation-states insist upon hopelessly resisting our dominance, the various small tribes and polities of the planet are a bit more practical at the best of times. We should incorporate them into our empire before other nations attempt to do the same."
 overwhelming_army:0 "Overwhelming Army"
 overwhelming_army_desc:0 "Even if the unified Omega mind didn't make coordinating complex tactical operations and logistics effortless, our agricultural productivity and reduced need for useless trinkets would still free up resources for our war machine. In a pinch, we can simply overwhelm our enemies with pure numbers."
 unimaginable_wealth:0 "Unimaginable Wealth"
 unimaginable_wealth_desc:0 "On our home planet, resources are allocated with perfect efficiency. Technological limitations prevent us from doing that here, but we're still rather better at it than the local primitives."
 overwhelming_navy:0 "Overwhelming Navy"
 overwhelming_navy_desc:0 "Earth is covered by massive oceans, and it's a wonder that any land is above sea level. It is utterly essential to our continued conquest that we devote more resources to oceanic endeavors, at least until suitable flying machines are rediscovered."
 financial_hegemony:0 "Financial Hegemony"
 financial_hegemony_desc:0 "Some of the locals want to purchase our goods with their bizarre, metal based currencies! We might as well play along. After all, if you control a man's money, you gain control of his thoughts, even if he hasn't been linked into the Omega mind just yet."
 futuristic_weaponry:0 "Futuristic Weaponry"
 futuristic_weaponry_desc:0 "While we lack the energy and material resources of the homeworld, we have made some success in optimizing local technology in ways the natives wouldn't independently think of for centuries. Tactical flintlock, anyone?"
