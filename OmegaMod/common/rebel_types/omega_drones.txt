# Omega drones.
# The lore here is that the Omega will send undercover agents into countries they're at war with to kidnap citizens and assimilate them into the Omegan hive mind.
# When they win a siege, they change the culture of the province to the new Omegan culture; the Omega also gets cores on them.
# If they can enforce their demands, the entire country is annexed by the Omega. This is definitely cruel, and I might adjust this down if I feel it necessary.
