EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently gold! (1.01). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's always room for further improvement. 1.01 adds compatibility with Mare Nostrum (1.16) and makes minor general improvements.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Improve the Omegan Insurrection, since it probably needs refinement.
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make more functions modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline;  this is an ongoing process.
- Possibly some more flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
- Add a new special Omegan government, to be enabled by high income, idea progress, time, or some other combination of the two.
