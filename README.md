EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in beta (v0.9). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvement. 0.9 adds the long-promised "Omegan Insurrection"; a human-only disaster that potentially can break your country and swarm you with drones. It also adds more localization for Omega-related subjects and gives the Omega a special casus belli.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- HIGH PRIORITY: 1.14 makes AI attitudes hardcoded, meaning the "Overwhelming" attitude will be unavailable. We will need to rely on other ways to make the Omega avoid diplomacy and favor conquest. 1.14 doesn't seem to change much else that would be particularly important, but do check any replacement files for 1.14 updates.
- Improve the Omegan Insurrection, since it probably needs refinement.
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make more functions modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline;  this is an ongoing process.
- Possibly some more flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
