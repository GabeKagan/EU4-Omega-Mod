EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently gold! (1.02). Most intended functionality has been implemented, but there's always room for further improvement. 1.02 is a minor compatibility patch for EU4 1.17

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Improve the Omegan Insurrection, since it probably needs refinement.
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make more functions modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline;  this is an ongoing process.
- Possibly some more flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
- Add a new special Omegan government, to be enabled by high income, idea progress, time, or some other combination of the two.
