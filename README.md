EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in beta (v0.9). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvement. 0.9 adds the long-promised "Omegan Insurrection"; a human-only disaster that potentially can break your country and swarm you with drones. It also adds more localization for Omega-related subjects and gives the Omega a special casus belli.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Improve the Omegan Insurrection, since it probably needs refinement.
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make more functions modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline;  this is an ongoing process.
- Possibly some more flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
